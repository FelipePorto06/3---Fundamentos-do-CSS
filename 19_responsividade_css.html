        I'm required by protocol to keep interaction with you to a minimum
        This will be our only chance to talk
        We've got a lot to do, but the important thing is you're back with me
        You should pace yourself, though, good luck
        We're bad omens, make some noise

        Look into my face, then look again
        We are not the same, we're different
        To tell your tales and fables
        You couldn't wait
        You need a new clean slate without the dents
        A place to put your pain, your consequence
        When you look into the mirror
        Are you even there?

        I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell
        It's hard enough being alone with myself
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on
        I know you tried your hardest, I know that you meant it well
        But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on

        So write a brand-new page, then write again
        I know your act is staged, yet you pretend
        All while you're turnin' tables, oh
        With missing legs
        I think you've overstayed your welcome in
        So go the fuck away, don't come again
        I'll see your face in the fire
        And burn it out

        I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell
        It's hard enough being alone with myself
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on
        I know you tried your hardest, I know that you meant it well
        But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on

        You know what's funny?
        I don't see a fucking mosh pit forming right now
        You know what to do in the pit right there, my friends

        Like a villain, I couldn't be
        I didn't need it, it needed me
        Like a villain, I couldn't be
        I didn't need it, it needed me

        Oh
        I didn't need it, it needed me

        I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell
        It's hard enough being alone with myself
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on
        I know you tried your hardest, I know that you meant it well
        But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on

        I didn't need it, it needed me
